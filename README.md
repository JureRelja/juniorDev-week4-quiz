In March 2023 I attended a 2-month long React education at [Digitalna Dalmacija](https://digitalnadalmacija.hr/). The education lasted for 8 weeks, and every week I was required to build a new project. This is the projects I build in the 4th week.

### Challenge

The task was to build a quiz app in React. The user can choose what type of questions and how many he wants and then generate a quiz with those questions. He then can answer those questions with real-time scores and feedback on each question.

### What I learned

This project was one of my favorite ones I made at Digitalna Dalmacija because it got me feeling for the first time that I have built something ready to use. Something that works as described and it's fun to use.

I learned how to utilize the useEffect hook, and how to manipulate component state to provide instant feedback to the user. I also learned how to use Axios to fetch data from an API.
